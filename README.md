![3DChan map edition](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPr82dOXsAAB70-?format=jpg&name=small)

The base concept of 3Dchan was to offer a 3D/Video game layer around the anonymous imageboard media. The first version was an online version (3Dchan.net), this one will be offline centered on level building and sharing between players.
__Important Note: this repo is an IN PROGRESS project, this mean than the present project will be barely working and non-ergonomic for a longtime__

## Status

Todo:
